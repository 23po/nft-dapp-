# SENDING DONATIONS USING NFTS

#### SIMPLE APPLICATION THAT GENERATES A NON - FUNGIBLE TOKEN FOR PARTICIPANT X

1. Dapp creates an account for participants x

2. Participant x can generate nft (set ulimited supply and minimum donation amt) 

3. A second participants (y) can purchase nft, sending funds to participant's x account

4. Participant x will use this dapp to list causes and programs that need funding. 

5. Participants y will use this dapp to send crypto to projects and causes by "purchasing a nft."

6. Other considerations include USSD frontend, etc, add additional use - cases etc..

7. However now let's focus on a dapp that can create 2 accounts, can generate a nft, and supports the buying of a nft and transfer of funds btwn accounts.
